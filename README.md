In this tutorial we will be developing a full stack application using Spring Boot
and Angular 7 and performing authentication using Login Page.

<a href="https://www.javainuse.com/spring/ang7-crud">In previous tutorial we had implemented - 
	Angular 7 + Spring Boot CRUD Example.</a>
	We had also created a menu with links to pages.<br>
	 In this tutorial we will be creating a Login and Logout page. We will be using a hard coded user name and password for authenticating
	 a user.
	 Also will be implementing session management so that
	 only a used who is logged in can view the pages. Else he will be directed to the login page. In the next tutorial
	 we will be implementing <a href="https://www.javainuse.com/spring/ang7-basic">Basic Authentication using Angular 7 and Spring Boot.</a><br>
